# Tsubakis-GroundCloud
A userscript designed and developed to make the groundcloud.io dashboard less painful.
The code will always be evolving and changing, lots of things I put in it works and I have not cleaned it up yet, JavaScript is newer to me in the sense of actually trying to use it for something so I will learn as I go.

Current updates are:
1. New Row "Est. To Completion" - Gives you an hour - minute estimation on route finish based off hourly stop average.
2. Stop progress bar is color-coded based on the 'Est. To Completion'.
3. The 'Name' row was renamed to 'Work Area'.
4. Custom notifications for whatever I suppose.

In-Progress:
1. Ability to collapse side-nav bar at any time (Kind of done)
2. Fix estimations for route completion, and change column data to 'Done' or something similar when route is completed.
3. Clean up any and all parts of the code always.

To-Do:
1. ???
