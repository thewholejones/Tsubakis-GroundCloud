# Tsubakis-GroundCloud
A userscript designed and developed to make the groundcloud.io dashboard less painful.
The code will always be evolving and changing, JavaScript is newer to me in the sense of actually trying to use it for something so I will learn as I go. So the code may be kind of gross or not make sense in some parts.

Current updates are:
1. New Row "Est. To Completion" - Gives you an hour - minute estimation on route finish based off hourly stop average.
2. Stop progress bar is color-coded based on the 'Est. To Completion'.
3. The 'Name' row was renamed to 'Work Area'.
4. Custom notifications for whatever I suppose.

In-Progress:
1. Ability to collapse side-nav bar at any time (Kind of done)
2. Fix estimations for route completion, and change column data to 'Done' or something similar when route is completed.
3. Clean up any and all parts of the code always.

To-Do:
1. ???

Bugs: 
1. Filtering the terminals wont update the data
2. If a driver finishes route and there is like 1 stop left the completion time will remain at a low number. Plan to fix this when I change the logic.
